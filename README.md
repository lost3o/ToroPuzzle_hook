# Toro and Friends: Onsen Town

Toro and Friends: Onsen Town (also known as Toro Puzzle or just Onsen Town) is a connect-three puzzle game like Candy Crush made by BeXide, ForwardWorks and PiG Games.

The game's servers were shut down in 2021, and the Android version has remained unplayable ever since, with the iOS version having offline mode.

# The wonders of archiving

Thanks to the Doko Demo Issyo fandom Discord server, we have the Toro Puzzle cache files of the most recent version, including every assetbundle downloaded by the game.

Because of this, a revival project is perfectly doable, and since the APK was both archived with the cache files and is also on APKPure, the game can actually be modded to work again, which is what we're currently doing

# Obstacles

The main obstacle currently is the servers. Synzr is currently remaking the almost entirety of the Neptune API to make the gake function as intended again, and of course, that takes a **lot** of time.

There's another issue currently that's related to this project, which is anti tampering. The anti tampering triggers most of the time and randomly stops working after a while, letting the game launch. I have no idea as to what is triggering the anti tampering, because every reference to it leads to the anti tampering smali file, but none of the classes that reference it are directly called.

# Why?

The reason why is just because the game doesn't deserve to be shut down. 

It's a boring and overused concept, but in itself, it's just another Doko Demo Issyo game left to rot. And we don't want that.

A lot of people have become curious about Doko Demo Issyo in general, and a mobile game that's translated to english would be both fun for people who don't know anything about it and for people that already know the series.

Long story short, it's just gonna be a Doko Demo Issyo game at the end of the day, and we want to bring it back to life
